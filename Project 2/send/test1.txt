In this project, you will implement a Transport Layer protocol
to transmit data from a Sender to a Receiver in the presence of
errors and packet loss. The protocol to be implemented by you
is the Stop-and-Wait protocol. The protocol will be
unidirectional in which data is sent in one direction only
with acknowledgments being sent in the reverse direction.
Only positive ACKs are used. The transmission of packets
and ACKs will be done over UDP (that represents an unreliable
network layer channel) using fixed UDP ports.


To implement this protocol, you will write two separate
programs called {\em Sender} and {\em Receiver} which
represent the actions to be executed by the sending node and
the receiving node respectively. Both the Sender and the
Receiver must run on the host {\em cis450.cis.udel.edu},
but they should be written in such a way that they could
conceivably be run on any two hosts, not necessarily the same.

\begin{verbatim}
    <----------------- 16 bits (2 bytes) ------------------>
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |              Count (no. of data bytes)               |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                Packet Sequence Number                |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |            Data Bytes      |          ...            |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

The second field of the header is called the
packet sequence number. Each
packet transmitted by the Sender is assigned
a sequence number that alternates between 0 and 1,
in accordance with the Stop-and-Wait protocol.
